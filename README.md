# Todo-App-MVVM
Its an app where users could easily add, delete, edit an activity and tick it as completed done. Tasks could
also be organized in order of importance, alphabetical order and date created. Users could also search for
particular to-do items if the list is long and also hide completed tasks to see uncompleted tasks. To achieve
this project, the following concepts were adopted
ˉ Use of MVVM software design pattern for separation of concern
ˉ ROOM for management of database operations (CRUD)
ˉ Navigation component to navigate between fragments
ˉ View binding to interact with UI elements
ˉ View model and live data to handle business logic
ˉ Flow for receiving most updated data from database
ˉ Data store for data persistence
ˉ Coroutine for multi-threading which provides better user experience
ˉ Dagger hilt for dependency injection

Implemented MVVM structure HOORAY!!!
There is already a dummy data of todo items.
You can add yours or interact with the UI as you wish
Just remember to swipe left or right to delete an item. Very Important Hahahaha
